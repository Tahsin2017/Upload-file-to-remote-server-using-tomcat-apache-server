# Upload-file-to-remote-server-using-tomcat-apache-server

***PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THE JAR FILE OF DATABASE CONNECTOR DRIVER IS ADDED TO YOUR JAVA PROJECT***
***AND APACHE TOMCAT SERVER IS INSTALLED***

This project uploads a selected file to a folder specified by tomcat apache server which is knows as the SERVLET. 

Then, it uploads the file to a database(local/remote) as a blob file. 

To get the content of the blob file from the database, a convertion query is used. 
Uncomment that portion of the code to see it working.
